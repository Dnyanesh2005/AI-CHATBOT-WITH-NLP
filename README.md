*DESCRIPTION*

In this AI Chatbot with NLP task, I explored how to build a basic conversational program capable of responding to user inputs using Natural Language Processing techniques. I worked in Google Colab and began by installing the **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) library, along with downloading resources like `punkt` for breaking text into tokens and `wordnet` for accessing a structured lexical database. These tools helped the chatbot interpret and process text more effectively.

I then created a list of predefined patterns linked to specific responses. For instance, when the user typed greetings such as “hi” or “hello,” the chatbot would return friendly replies, while questions like “what is Python?” would provide a short explanation about the language’s capabilities. Using the `Chat` class and `reflections` feature from NLTK, I made the bot’s responses sound more natural by automatically adjusting pronouns and phrasing.

After writing the code, I tested the chatbot with different types of input, including greetings, casual questions, and farewells. The bot was able to match the input patterns and reply accordingly.

This task was completed using **Python** and **NLTK** in Google Colab, giving me practical experience with rule-based chatbot creation, text pattern matching, and basic NLP concepts.
